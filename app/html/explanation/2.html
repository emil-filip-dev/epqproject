        Explanation Page 2: Nuclear fusion
    </h3>
    <p>
        Nuclear fusion is what happens when two atoms "fuse" together into a single, larger atom.
    </p>
    <p>
        This new atom tends to have more protons and neutrons than the other, smaller atoms. However, sometimes, a
        neutron or even larger particles may be emitted when the two atoms fuse.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nuclear fusion can happen with any element on the periodic table, and their isotopes. However, it is easier to
        achieve with smaller atoms than larger ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this reason, the main nuclear fusion reaction worth considering is that involving deuterium and tritium:
    </p>
    <div class="imageContainer" style="width: 100%; padding-top: 59.8%;">
            <img class="image"
                 src="/resources/img/fusion.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p>
        This reaction produces a free neutron, a helium nucleus and energy.
    </p>
    <p>
        The energy produced may seem like it comes from nowhere, but that is not the case. The resultant mass of the
        reaction is smaller than the input mass.
    </p>
    <p>
        The change in mass gets converted to energy according to <b>E = mc<sup>2</sup></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fusion produces a lot of energy, but not infinite energy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fusion reactions also require very specific conditions to occur, which are explained on the following page.
