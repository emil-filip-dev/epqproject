    <p>
        All matter is made up of tiny structures called atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Atoms are made of a nucleus (containing protons and neutrons) which has electrons orbiting around it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every element on the periodic table is made up of the same type of atom.
    </p>
    <p>
        An isotope of an element is an atom that has more (or fewer) neutrons than usual, but the same number of
        protons.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen) has one neutron while hydrogen has none. <br>
        Another isotope of hydrogen is tritium, which has two neutrons.
    </p>

                                       display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

        It is also important to understand the relationship between "mass" and "energy". Modern physics tells us that
        mass can be "converted" into energy, typically thermal energy. While this is not technically correct, it is
        an easy way of describing what happens during certain atomic reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This mass-energy conversion is shown by Albert Einstein's famous equation:
    </p>
    <div class="imageContainer" style="position: relative;
                                       width: 50%; padding-top: calc((427 / 1280) * 50%);
                                       display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <img class="image"
                 src="/resources/img/emc2.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
        The E in the equation above means "Energy" (measured in Joules), m means "mass" (measured in kilograms) and c
        means "the speed of light" (approximately equal to 300,000,000 m/s).

        Everything discussed in this page is key towards understanding how fusion energy is created.
