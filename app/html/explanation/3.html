        Explanation Page 3: Heat, pressure and forces
    </h3>
    <p>
        Fusion reaction cannot happen at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
        It requires a huge amount of heat and pressure in order for the atoms involved to fuse.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is due to two of the Fundamental Forces Of Nature: the strong force and the electromagnetic force.
    </p>
    <p>
        The strong force keeps atomic nuclei together, and is the main force which causes atoms to fuse into larger
        atoms. However, it acts over an incredibly short distance (about 1 femtometre - that's just
        0.000000000000001 metres!).
    </p>
    <div class="imageContainer" style="position: relative;
                                       width: 30%; padding-top: calc((239 / 298) * 30%);
                                       display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <img class="image"
                 src="/resources/img/strong_force.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
        The electromagnetic force involves the charges of the different parts of an atom. Protons are positive and
        electrons are negative. Like charges repel but opposite charges attract, which is why electrons orbit around
        atoms instead of flying off into the surrounding space.
    </p>
    <div class="imageContainer" style="position: relative;
                                       width: 30%; padding-top: calc((238 / 281) * 30%);
                                       display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <img class="image"
                 src="/resources/img/electromagnetic_force.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
        The electromagnetic force acts over a much larger distance than the strong force.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, since electrons surrounding the atomic nuclei are negative, trying to push two atoms together would result
        in the electrons repelling each other and therefore the atoms would not be able to go close enough to each
        other for the strong force to take effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        What must be done is the atoms must be stripped of their electrons first, leaving only the nuclei behind.
    </p>
    <p>
        This process is called <b>ionisation</b> and it only happens at very high temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
        The high heat makes electrons move away from the nuclei they were previously orbiting, which creates a "sea" of
        free negatively-charged electrons and positively-charged atomic nuclei, called <b>plasma.</b>
    </p>
    <div class="imageContainer" style="position: relative;
                                       width: 100%; padding-top: calc((616 / 1544) * 100%);
                                       display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <img class="image"
                 src="/resources/img/plasma_state_of_matter.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
        Plasma is another state of matter (separate from solid, liquid and gas). It is the very thing that fire is made
        up of.
    </p>
    <div class="imageContainer" style="position: relative;
                                       width: 50%; padding-top: calc((774 / 1024) * 50%);
                                       display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <img class="image"
                 src="/resources/img/match.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p>
        So, in plasma, the atomic nuclei are free of electrons and therefore are easier to fuse together. However,
        nuclei are positive because they contain protons. As a result, they still need to be pushed together in order
        to fuse.
    </p>
    <div class="imageContainer" style="position: relative;
                                       width: 100%; padding-top: calc((864 / 1920) * 100%);
                                       display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <img class="image"
                 src="/resources/img/electrostatic_repulsion.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
        An incredibly high amount of pressure is required to fuse the atomic nuclei.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is why fusion does not easily happen naturally. The only natural environment where fusion can occur is at
        the centre of stars, like our Sun.
    </p>
    <div class="imageContainer" style="position: relative;
                                       width: 50%; padding-top: calc((1590 / 2048) * 50%);
                                       display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <img class="image"
                 src="/resources/img/sun.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p>
        The reason that our Sun emit heats and shines light is that it is constantly fusing hydrogen atoms into helium
        at its core. It will continue to do so for millions of years until it drains its hydrogen reserves.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is very difficult to replicate the conditions of the Sun's core on Earth, but not impossible. See the
        <a href="/production/1">Production</a> tab for ways to produce fusion energy!
