        Production Page 2: Stellarators
    </h3>
    <p>
        A stellarator is similar to a tokamak, except that external magnets are used instead of letting the plasma
        act as its own magnet.
    </p>
    <p>
        These magnets are essentially "coils" that are built around a torus-shaped cloud of plasma. They conduct
        a current and generate a magnetic field around them that affects the plasma as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some stellarator designs may be twisted so as to better contain the plasma.
    </p>

    <p>
        Stellarators do not use an electric current to heat and contain the plasma.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, they use something called a magnetic pumping system. Radio waves are sent into the plasma chamber,
        energising the plasma particles and making them flow closer together, resulting in an increase in pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
        This increase in pressure also results in an increase in temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, the entire plasma cloud does not move and is not charged (even though at the atomic level, nuclei are
        moving around at a high speed).
