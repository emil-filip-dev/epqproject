        Production Page 4: Waste disposal
    </h3>
    <p>
        Just like all other forms of energy production, fusion energy also produces waste.
    </p>
    <p>
        This comes mainly in the form of plasma containers that have been bombarded with the neutrons produced by
        fusion and have therefore become radioactive.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
        Over time, the constant volley of neutrons hitting the plasma chamber eventually destroys it (at least with
        current designs), meaning it will have to be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The amount of waste produced by a fusion reactor once it shuts down is similar to the amount of waste a
        nuclear power plant produces.
    </p>
    <p>
        This may concern some people, as this can be interpreted that fusion reactors produce a lot of waste.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there are differences between fusion power waste and nuclear power waste:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Waste produced by fusion reactors decays (stops being radioactive) much quicker.
        </li>
        <li>
            Waste management is much easier, as extremely long-term solutions do not need to be implemented.
        </li>
        <li>
            The raw fuel (deuterium) needed by fusion reactors is not radioactive. It is true that fusion reactors
            also need tritium, which is radioactive, but they can produce it themselves (as explained on the
            <a href="/production/5">next page</a>.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Using certain materials which are more "resistant" to neutron bombardment can greatly reduce the amount
            of radioactive waste produced by fusion reactors. This is not an option with nuclear reactors.
        </li>
    </ul>
