        A tokamak is a machine used to produce electricity using fusion.

    <p>
        A tokamak works by taking in fuel and heating it up to a very high temperature until it turns into plasma. It
        then makes the plasma flow in a torus shape (a doughnut shape).
    </p>
    <p>
        The flowing plasma then acts as its own magnet, keeping itself together as fusion occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
        This requires an electric current to be run through the plasma. Running an electric current through anything
        will result in a magnetic field being produced as well, which is the way the plasma is contained.
    </p>
    <p>
        The transformer at the centre of the torus shape in the picture above is where the electricity will be flowing
        from.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tokamak is considered the most viable candidate for a conceivable fusion energy device, and hence research
        into a stable design is actively receiving the most funding from organisations.
