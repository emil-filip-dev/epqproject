        Production Page 3: Z-pinch
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Z-pinch technique is one of the oldest proposed methods of producing sustainable fusion energy.
    </p>
    <p>
        It involves "pinching" (compressing) the plasma into a very small space by running an electric current through
        it, generating a magnetic field that compresses the plasma.

    </div>
    <p>
        It is called "Z"-pinch because typical early models of such a device would compress plasma upwards, which is
        the Z direction on a three-dimensional graph.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, any machine that compresses plasma in this way is called a Z-pinch device, regardless of the direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Z-pinch is not researched much nowadays due to an inherent instability that it has. All Z-pinch devices would
        make the plasma hit the walls of its container, which would break the container and prevent the plasma
        from reaching the conditions it needs to undergo fusion (as can be seen below; the left image is at the start
        of the experiment, and the right is at the end).

                 src="/resources/img/z_pinch_instability.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p>
        Despite this, there have been some recent developments in the Z-pinch technique, as described in the
        <a target="_parent" href="/research/3">Research</a> tab.
