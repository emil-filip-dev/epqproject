    </h3>
    <p>
        The main fuels for fusion reactors are deuterium and tritium.
    </p>
    <p>
        As written in the <a target="_parent" href="/explanation/1">Explanation</a> tab, they are both isotopes of hydrogen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Deuterium is easy to come by, as it can be found in normal samples of water (with about 1 in every 7000 hydrogen
        atoms in water molecules being a deuterium atom). However, it is more common in seawater.
    </p>
    <p>
        Deuterium is produced via a process called electrolysis, which involves passing an electric current through
        water molecules, making the hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms break apart from each other. The deuterium atoms
        are then separated from the hydrogen atoms and collected.

    <p>
        Tritium is produced by a process involving neutrons hitting a lithium sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
        The neutrons in questions could be used straight from a fusion reaction, as the fusion between deuterium and
        tritium produces neutrons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, only a small amount of tritium is required to kick-start the fusion reaction, then it can be
        produced as fusion occurs.
