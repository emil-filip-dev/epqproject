        Future Page 2: Private use

    <p>
        Those who have seen Back To The Future 2 may remember a certain device named Mr Fusion.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was described as a miniature fusion reactor which would use ordinary trash as fusion fuel and produce
        electricity.
    </p>
    <div class="imageContainer" style="position: relative;
                                       width: 75%; padding-top: calc((500 / 775) * 75%);
                                       display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <img class="image"
                 src="/resources/img/mr_fusion.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p>
        It is a certain impossibility that a device able to fuse trash would ever exist. However,  it is probable that
        in the future, we will have miniature fusion reactors.
    </p>
    <p>
        These mini reactors would not be housed within a huge industrial site dedicated to producing energy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, they would be stored in more common buildings, such as in a factory, or a basement of an office
        building, or even a house.
    </p>
    <p>
        These reactors would not be able to produce as much energy as the larger ones, but would be able to produce
        enough electricity to power the building they are contained in.
    </p>
    <p>
        While this may sound an impossibility at first, the recent breakthrough with the Z-pinch technique may
        indicate otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps someday we will all have fusion reactors in our homes.
