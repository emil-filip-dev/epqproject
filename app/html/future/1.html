        Future Page 1: Solving the worldwide energy crisis
    </h3>
    <p>
        Currently, the world is experiencing a shortage of energy, dubbed the Energy Crisis. Present methods of
        obtaining energy (thermal, wind, solar, hydroelectric and nuclear power) are too inefficient (the least
        inefficient method is nuclear power) or even harmful for the environment and humans.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thermal power is especially harmful as it involves burning fossil fuels, which accelerates the Greenhouse Effect
        and therefore global warming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nonetheless, humans still use these inefficient methods to produce energy. For example, the vast majority
        of energy consumption in the United States in 2017 came from thermal power sources.

    </div>
    <p>
        While nuclear power is currently the most viable source of energy, it too has its problems. For one,
        nuclear fuel is difficult to come by and needs to be enriched before it can be used, which is an extremely
        expensive process.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, nuclear power produces a lot of nuclear waste which cannot be broken down into safe waste. It must
        be buried and left under the ground until its radioactivity declines to a safe level.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also inefficient, as nuclear power plants work by heating water using a nuclear reaction called fission
        until it turns into steam, then using the pressurised steam to turn a generator turbine and produce electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
        A lot of energy is lost this way.

        Fusion energy seemingly has the answer to the energy crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fuel for fusion is cheap to produce, waste products are relatively easy to manage and it yields a very large
        amount of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, the only problems concerning fusion energy are the inefficiency of current fusion reactor designs
        (but that will change as more research is being done) and the complexity of the devices used to produce it.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is much harder to produce energy via fusion reactions than by burning coal, for example. As a result,
        building fusion reactors would be very costly in the short term.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, in the long term, fusion energy pays off.
    </p>

        Refer to this chart to see how much more superior fusion energy is to other sources of energy:
