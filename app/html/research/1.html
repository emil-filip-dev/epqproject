        Research Page 1: ITER
    </h3>
    <p>
        The International Thermonuclear Experiment Reactor (ITER) is a fusion research project which, once completed,
        will be the largest tokamak in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project, run by the EU, India, Japan, China, Russia, South Kora and the US, is expected to cost more than
        20 billion Euros and its construction should be completed in late 2025. It will be built in the Cadarache
        region in France.
    </p>
    <p>
        The EU is the biggest financial contributor to the project; it covers approximately 45% of ITER's cost.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a drawing of a cross-section of ITER when finished:
    </p>
    <div class="imageContainer" style="width: 100%; padding-top: calc((940 / 1920) * 100%);">
            <img class="image"
                 src="/resources/img/completed_ITER_drawing.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p>
        ITER will take in 50 megawatts of heat power and will output 500 megawatts from the fusion of its plasma. This
        is a fusion power gain of 1000%.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, ITER will not produce electricity with this power. It is designed to be used only as a research device,
        so that scientists may construct better designs for fusion devices based on how ITER works.
    </p>

                 src="/resources/img/ITER_exhibit.jpg" />
    </div>
    <p>
        ITER is planned to begin accepting a constant supply of deuterium and tritium fuel in 2035, after numerous
        tests are conducted.
    </p>
    <p>
        A "sequel" to ITER is planned, named DEMO (short for DEMOnstration Power Station).
    </p>
    <p>
        It will produce up to 4 gigawatts of output thermal power, while requiring only 80 megawatts of input thermal
        power (excluding the electrical power needed to operate the machine).
    </p>
    <p>
        Its fusion power gain will therefore be 2500%.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for electricity production, DEMO's design will produce up to 500 megawatts of electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is estimated that DEMO will be 50% larger than ITER and will have 30% denser plasma.
    </p>
    <p>
        The European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA)'s 2012 estimates said that DEMO should be ready for operation
        from 2044.

    </div>
    <p>
        A third device has also been thought of, named PROTO. Its purpose would be to test updates to the designs of the
        previous two fusion power stations and apply them in a commercially viable way. Not much is known about PROTO.
        It may be part of the DEMO project rather than a separate project on its own.
