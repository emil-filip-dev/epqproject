        Research Page 2: SPARC
    </h3>
    <p>
        SPARC is a collaborative effort between MIT and the privately-funded company Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS)
        to bring sustainable fusion energy to the commercial stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a compact tokamak device that will use a revolutionary new type of electromagnet.

    </div>
    <p>
        Once completed, it is expected to produce 100 megawatts of fusion power.
    </p>
    <p>
        This may only be a fifth of ITER's output, but MIT and CFS claim that SPARC will be 1/65 of the size of ITER.
    </p>
    <p>
        This indicates that SPARC will be massively more efficient in terms of space, possibly hinting towards an even
        smaller version that could fit in a very small space.
    </p>
    <p>
        SPARC is considered to be complimentary to ITER, in that it would enable fusion power production at the
        local level, rather than requiring a huge facility like ITER's.
