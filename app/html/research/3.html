        Research Page 3: Wendelstein 7-X
    </h3>
    <p>
        This is the most well-known example of stellarator technology being used.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Wendelstein 7-X was completed in October 2015, in Greifswald, Germany.

    <p>
        Its purpose is to provide a way of researching possible improvements to the stellarator design, so it does not
        produce electricity. Any heat it produces is released into the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
        The W7-X functions as a typical stellarator.
    </p>
    <p>
        Its coils produce a very strong magnetic field to contain the plasma, the plasma is heated and pressurized until
        it fuses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Supercomputers were involved in the design stage of the W7-X.
    </p>
    <p>
        This could pave a way for computer-managed fusion reactions, which could potentially be much more efficient.
