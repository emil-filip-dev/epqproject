    <h3>Welcome to the index of my EPQ Project website!</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to offer an easy introduction to fusion energy.</p>
    <p>Understanding the basics of fusion energy is important, as it could become humanity's main source of energy in
        the future.</p>
    <p>The information is intended to be read tab-by-tab and page-by-page.</p>
    <p>A minimum GCSE-grade level of knowledge is recommended, but some topics are much easier to understand than
        others. Feel free to go at your own pace!</p>
    <p>A large number of animations and videos are provided to ease understanding. Check out the Further Reading tab
        for more resources and the links for the videos and animations!</p>
    <p>If you're ready, try out the Quiz and see how high you can score!</p>
    <p>Have fun!</p>
    <p></p>
