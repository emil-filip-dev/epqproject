# EPQ Project - Building a Website From Scratch

This was my EPQ project from 2018-2019.

The purpose of this project was to learn about building a website from scratch using minimal third party tools, to gain a complete understanding of web development.

I developed a website using **HTML**, **JavaScript** (with the **jQuery** library), and **CSS**, hosted on an **AWS Lightsail** instance running Linux and a free domain name. The backend was a simple **Flask** program that served the HTML/JS/CSS content when the user queried a certain page URL.

The website displayed informational content about fusion energy, aiming to educate students taking GCSE Physics about the concept of generating energy using nuclear fusion, its benefits, its difficulties, and what the future developments in the field are.

This project laid the groundwork for me to become proficient in web development, user interface development, and backend development.
